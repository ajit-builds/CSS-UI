# 🪐 Solar System CSS Animation

A lightweight, pure CSS animation demonstrating orbital mechanics. This project visualizes the relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon using nested HTML structures and CSS3 keyframes.

## 📖 About The Project

This project was built to demonstrate how **CSS Keyframes** and **Positioning** can be used to create complex animations without writing a single line of JavaScript.

### Key Features
* **Pure CSS:** Zero JavaScript used.
* **Nested Orbits:** The Moon orbits the Earth *while* the Earth orbits the Sun.
* **Responsive:** Centered layout using Flexbox.
* **Visuals:** Glowing effects using `box-shadow` and semi-transparent orbital rings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Animation, Flexbox, Variables)

## 🚀 Development Stages (Commit History)

This project was built incrementally in 8 distinct stages to ensure clean code structure:

1.  **Initial Setup:** Created HTML skeleton and file structure.
2.  **Base Styling:** Applied CSS reset, dark space background, and flex centering.
3.  **The Sun:** Rendered the central star with glowing CSS effects.
4.  **Earth's Orbit:** Created the trajectory path for the Earth.
5.  **The Earth:** Added the planet to its orbit ring.
6.  **Moon's Orbit:** Created a nested trajectory path around the Earth.
7.  **The Moon:** Added the satellite to the Earth's orbit.
8.  **Animation Activation:** Applied `360deg` rotation keyframes to bring the system to life.
